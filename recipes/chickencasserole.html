        <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 box (14.1 oz) refrigerated Pillsbury&trade; Pie Crusts (2 Count), softened as directed on box</li>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups water</li>
            <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
            <li>1 (6 ounce) package quick-cooking stuffing mix (such as Stove Top&reg;), or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, diced</li>
            <li>3 stalks celery, diced, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can low-sodium cream of chicken soup</li>
            <li>1/2 (10.5 ounce) can low-sodium cream of mushroom soup</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) container sour cream</li>
            <li>1 whole cooked rotisserie chicken - skinned, boned, and meat shredded</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Bring water and 1/4 cup butter to a boil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add stuffing mix and stir to combine. Remove the saucepan from the heat, cover, and let sit until water is absorbed, about 5 minutes. Fluff stuffing with a fork.</li>
            <li>While you are preparing stuffing, melt 1 tablespoon butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion and celery; cook and stir until softened, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mix both condensed soups with sour cream in a bowl until well combined.</li>
            <li>Spread shredded chicken in the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Layer onion mixture over chicken and season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Top with soup mixture and spread stuffing evenly over top.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until filling is bubbly and topping is golden brown, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Ingredient Substitutions</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Chicken</strong>: The Allrecipes community loves this recipe because it calls for rotisserie chicken, a quick and convenient alternative to cooking your own chicken. But you don't necessarily have to use rotisserie chicken! You can use any shredded, cooked chicken you want.</li>
            <li><strong>Condensed Soup</strong>: This casserole recipe calls for two cans of low-sodium condensed soup: cream of chicken and cream of mushroom. You can use two cans of one or the other or you can switch things up a bit by substituting one can for condensed cream of celery soup.</li>
            <li><strong>Sour Cream</strong>: No sour cream? No problem! Reviewers say mayonnaise works just as well. You can substitute on a 1:1 ratio (use 8 ounces of mayo since this recipe calls for 8 ounces of sour cream).</li>
            <li>For a pop of flavor and color, try adding fresh or frozen veggies into the mix. Peas, carrots, green beans, mushrooms, and corn all work very well in this rotisserie chicken and stuffing casserole recipe.</li>
        </ol>
