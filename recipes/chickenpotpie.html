        <p>A good chicken pot pie has a buttery, flaky crust and a creamy filling packed with chicken and veggies.</p>
        <p>Chicken pot pie is one of my all-time favorite meals. I remember coming home from school to smell the amazing aroma of baking crust and scrumptious filling. Chicken pot pie is a nutritious and tasty meal that the whole family will enjoy!</p>
        <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 box (14.1 oz) refrigerated Pillsbury&trade; Pie Crusts (2 Count), softened as directed on box</li>
            <li>1/3 cup butter or margarine</li>
            <li>1/3 cup chopped onion</li>
            <li>1/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
            <li>1 3/4 cups from 1 carton (32 oz) Progresso&trade; Classic Chicken Broth</li>
            <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups shredded cooked chicken or turkey</li>
            <li>2 cups frozen mixed vegetables, thawed</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oven to 425°F. Prepare pie crusts as directed on box for Two-Crust Pie using 9-inch glass pie pan.</li>
            <li>In 2-quart saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Add onion; cook 2 minutes, stirring frequently, until tender. Stir in flour, salt and pepper until well blended. Gradually stir in broth and milk, cooking and stirring until bubbly and thickened.</li>
            <li>Stir in chicken and mixed vegetables. Remove from heat. Spoon chicken mixture into crust-lined pan. Top with second crust; seal edge and flute. Cut slits in several places in top crust.</li>
            <li>Bake 30 to 40 minutes or until crust is golden brown. During last 15 to 20 minutes of baking, cover crust edge with strips of foil to prevent excessive browning. Let stand 5 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Tips</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Make a foil collar (or pie crust shield) to protect the edges of the pastry from overbrowning. Place strips of foil to cover crust during the last 15 or 20 minutes of baking.</li>
            <li>A standard 9-inch glass pie plate works best for this recipe.</li>
            <li>The only complicated part of making a pot pie is the pastry. By using a refrigerated dough you’re left with making a quick, savory gravy that can be filled with leftover cooked chicken, turkey, or ham and a good handful of veggies. A dash of poultry seasoning or some finely chopped fresh sage will enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>
        </ol>
