            <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
            <ul class="unordered">
                <li>1 (8 ounce) box elbow macaroni</li>
                <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
                <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>2 cups milk</li>
                <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
            <ol class="ordered">
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes.</li>
                <li>At the same time, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat.</li>
                <li>Add flour, salt, and pepper and stir until smooth, about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Pour in milk slowly, while stirring continuously. Continue to cook and stir until mixture is smooth and bubbling, about 5 minutes, making sure the milk doesn't burn.</li>
                <li>Add Cheddar cheese and stir until melted, 2 to 4 minutes.</li>
                <li>Drain macaroni and fold into cheese sauce until coated.</li>
                <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
            <ul class="tips">
                <li>You can never have enough cheese, and I usually add an extra 1/2 cup without ruining the recipe.</li>
                <li>Keep a careful eye on the milk when boiling, as milk boils fast and burns easily. Burnt milk will show up in the recipe's flavor if overcooked.</li>
            </ul>
